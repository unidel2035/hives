## Duplicate Comment Issue (Issue #665)

The last two comments (Comments #6 and #7) represent a duplicate finishing status:

1. **Comment #6**: "🤖 Solution Draft Log" with Gist link and footer text "Now working session is ended..."
2. **Comment #7**: "🤖 AI Work Session Completed" with session end time

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Code Flow Investigation

The duplicate comments are generated from two separate function calls in `src/solve.mjs`:

1. **Lines 918-928**: `attachLogToGitHub()` function call
   - Located in: `src/github.lib.mjs` (lines 491-791)
   - Posts: "🤖 Solution Draft Log" comment with footer: "Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft."

2. **Lines 942-949**: `endWorkSession()` function call
   - Located in: `src/solve.session.lib.mjs` (lines 69-128)
   - Posts: "🤖 AI Work Session Completed" comment

#### Code Evidence

**src/solve.mjs (lines 914-949)**:
```javascript
// Attach updated logs to PR after auto-restart completes
if (shouldAttachLogs && prNumber) {
  await log('📎 Uploading working session logs to Pull Request...');
  try {
    const logUploadSuccess = await attachLogToGitHub({
      logFile: getLogFile(),
      targetType: 'pr',
      targetNumber: prNumber,
      owner,
      repo,
      $,
      log,
      sanitizeLogContent,
      verbose: argv.verbose
    });

    if (logUploadSuccess) {
      await log('✅ Working session logs uploaded successfully');
    } else {
      await log('⚠️  Failed to upload working session logs', { level: 'warning' });
    }
  } catch (uploadError) {
    await log(`⚠️  Error uploading logs: ${uploadError.message}`, { level: 'warning' });
  }
}

// End work session using the new module
await endWorkSession({
  isContinueMode,
  prNumber,
  argv,
  log,
  formatAligned,
  $
});
```

**src/github.lib.mjs (lines 571-589)**:
```javascript
// Success log format
const costInfo = totalCostUSD !== null ? `\n\n💰 **Total estimated cost**: $${totalCostUSD.toFixed(6)} USD` : '';
logComment = `## ${customTitle}

This log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI ${targetType === 'pr' ? 'solution draft' : 'analysis'} process.${costInfo}

📎 **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (${Math.round(logStats.size / 1024)}KB)
🔗 [View complete solution draft log](${gistUrl})

---
*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*`;
```

**src/solve.session.lib.mjs (lines 82-88)**:
```javascript
// Post a comment marking the end of work session
try {
  const endComment = `🤖 **AI Work Session Completed**\n\nWork session ended at ${workEndTime.toISOString()}\n\nThe PR will be converted back to ready for review.\n\n_This comment marks the end of an AI work session. New comments after this time will be considered as feedback._`;
  const commentResult = await $`gh pr comment ${prNumber} --repo ${global.owner}/${global.repo} --body ${endComment}`;
  if (commentResult.code === 0) {
    await log(formatAligned('💬', 'Posted:', 'Work session end comment', 2));
  }
```

### Problem Summary

Both functions include text indicating the session has ended:
- `attachLogToGitHub()` includes: "*Now working session is ended, feel free to review...*"
- `endWorkSession()` posts: "**AI Work Session Completed**"

This creates redundant finishing status comments that clutter the PR conversation.

## Recommended Solution

According to issue #665, we should:

1. **Keep the "🤖 Solution Draft Log" comment** (from `attachLogToGitHub()`)
   - It provides the actual log file content/link
   - It includes cost information
   - It already has footer text indicating session end

2. **Remove or conditionally skip the "AI Work Session Completed" comment** (from `endWorkSession()`)
   - Only post it when logs are NOT being attached
   - The log attachment comment already serves as the finishing status

### Implementation Strategy

Modify the `endWorkSession()` function to accept an optional parameter indicating whether logs were already attached:

```javascript
export async function endWorkSession({
  isContinueMode,
  prNumber,
  argv,
  log,
  formatAligned,
  $,
  logsAttached = false  // NEW PARAMETER
}) {
  if (isContinueMode && prNumber && (argv.watch || argv.autoContinue)) {
    const workEndTime = new Date();
    await log(`\n${formatAligned('🏁', 'Ending work session:', workEndTime.toISOString())}`);

    // Only post end comment if logs were NOT already attached
    // The attachLogToGitHub comment already serves as finishing status
    if (!logsAttached) {
      // Post a comment marking the end of work session
      try {
        const endComment = `🤖 **AI Work Session Completed**\n\nWork session ended at ${workEndTime.toISOString()}\n\nThe PR will be converted back to ready for review.\n\n_This comment marks the end of an AI work session. New comments after this time will be considered as feedback._`;
        const commentResult = await $`gh pr comment ${prNumber} --repo ${global.owner}/${global.repo} --body ${endComment}`;
        if (commentResult.code === 0) {
          await log(formatAligned('💬', 'Posted:', 'Work session end comment', 2));
        }
      } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling
      }
    } else {
      await log(formatAligned('ℹ️', 'Skipping:', 'End comment (logs already attached)', 2));
    }

    // Convert PR back to ready for review (this should always happen)
    // ... rest of the function
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Test with --attach-logs flag**: Verify only "Solution Draft Log" comment is posted
2. **Test without --attach-logs flag**: Verify "AI Work Session Completed" comment is posted
3. **Test with --auto-continue**: Verify correct behavior across multiple work sessions
4. **Test watch mode**: Verify session comments are appropriately posted/skipped

## Commits in PR #609

The PR includes 8 commits demonstrating good commit hygiene:

1. Initial commit with task details
2. Main implementation with co-authorship
3. Revert of task details file
4. Real-time usage implementation
5. Experiment scripts documentation
6. Reference screenshots
7. Merge main branch and resolve conflicts
8. ESLint fix

## Key Takeaways

1. **Session Management**: Work sessions should have clear start/end markers
2. **Comment Deduplication**: Avoid posting multiple comments with similar "session ended" messages
3. **Log Attachments**: When logs are attached, they should serve as the primary finishing status
4. **User Experience**: Minimize comment clutter while maintaining clear communication
5. **Cost Transparency**: Include cost information in solution draft logs when available
