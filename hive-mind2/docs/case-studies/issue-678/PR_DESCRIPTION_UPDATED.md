# Fix PR Creation Failures in Fork Mode and Auto-Continue

## 🎯 Summary

This PR completely resolves issue #678 by addressing **both** root causes of PR creation failures:

1. **Problem 1 (v0.29.5)**: Identical content when reusing branches with `--auto-continue`
2. **Problem 2 (v0.29.7)**: Fork mode regression with Compare API 404 errors

## 📋 Issue Reference

Fixes #678

## 🔍 Deep Analysis

After thorough investigation of user-reported logs and multiple testing scenarios, I've identified the true root causes and implemented complete solutions.

### Problem 1: "No Commits Between Branches" Error

**Symptom**: When using `--auto-continue` to reuse existing branches, PR creation fails with:
```
GraphQL: No commits between master and issue-1-b53fe3666f91
```

**What the logs showed**:
```
[10:00:15.117Z] CLAUDE.md already exists, appending task info...
[10:00:15.199Z] Commit created: 9d8c4fc
[10:00:16.535Z] Push output: 8ee8459..9d8c4fc  issue-1-b53fe3666f91 -> issue-1-b53fe3666f91
[10:00:30.151Z] ERROR: No commits between master and issue-1-b53fe3666f91
```

**Root Cause**: Git commits were created and pushed successfully, but GitHub's PR API rejected them because the **tree (content)** was identical to the base branch. Here's why:

1. First run: Creates CLAUDE.md with task info, commits, pushes
2. PR creation fails (network, permission, etc.)
3. CLAUDE.md remains in branch (wasn't cleaned up due to failure)
4. Second run with `--auto-continue`: Checks out existing branch
5. CLAUDE.md already exists, code appends same task info
6. Result: File content is unchanged or minimally changed
7. Git creates commit (different SHA) but tree is identical
8. GitHub PR creation: "No commits between branches"

**Key Insight**: GitHub doesn't check if different commits exist—it checks if the **content differs**. This is why a new commit with identical content fails.

**Solution (v0.29.8)**: Add timestamp to make content unique every run:
```javascript
finalContent = `${trimmedExisting}\n\n---\n\n${taskInfo}\n\nRun timestamp: ${timestamp}`;
```

### Problem 2: Fork Mode Compare API 404 Errors

**Symptom**: In fork mode, Compare API check fails repeatedly with 404 errors:
```
[12:28:48.248Z] Push succeeds to fork: konard/anti-corruption
[12:28:50.768Z] Compare API error (attempt 1/5): {"message":"Not Found","status":"404"}
[12:28:55.263Z] Compare API error (attempt 2/5): {"message":"Not Found","status":"404"}
... continues for 5 attempts over 30+ seconds
```

**Root Cause**: The Compare API check (added in v0.29.7 to handle GitHub sync delays) was using the wrong head reference format for fork mode:

❌ **Wrong** (v0.29.7):
```
repos/xlabtg/anti-corruption/compare/main...issue-6-01d3f376c347
```
Problem: Branch `issue-6-01d3f376c347` only exists in `konard/anti-corruption` (fork), not in `xlabtg/anti-corruption` (upstream)

✅ **Correct** (v0.29.9):
```
repos/xlabtg/anti-corruption/compare/main...konard:issue-6-01d3f376c347
```
This tells GitHub to look for the branch in the fork using the `forkUser:branch` format.

**Solution (v0.29.9)**: Detect fork mode and construct correct head reference:
```javascript
let headRef;
if (argv.fork && forkedRepo) {
  const forkUser = forkedRepo.split('/')[0];
  headRef = `${forkUser}:${branchName}`;  // e.g., "konard:issue-678-abc"
} else {
  headRef = branchName;  // e.g., "issue-678-abc"
}
const compareResult = await $({ silent: true })`gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/compare/${targetBranchForCompare}...${headRef} --jq '.ahead_by' 2>&1`;
```

This matches the format used in `gh pr create` and correctly references branches in forks.

## 🐛 Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Identical Content When Reusing Branches (v0.29.5)

When using `--auto-continue` mode with existing branches:
1. Checkout existing branch
2. Append task information to CLAUDE.md
3. Create commit and push
4. **PR creation fails**: "No commits between branches"

**Root Cause**: Task information appended to CLAUDE.md was deterministic (same content each run), causing GitHub to see no meaningful changes.

### Problem 2: Fork Mode 404 Errors (v0.29.7 regression)

In fork mode, Compare API check failed with 404 errors:
```
Compare API error: {"message":"Not Found","status":"404"}
```

**Root Cause**: Compare API was called with incorrect head reference:
- Used: `repos/upstream/repo/compare/main...branch-name`
- Problem: Branch only exists in fork, not upstream
- Result: GitHub returns 404 error

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Add Timestamp to CLAUDE.md (v0.29.8 - commit ecfd412)

```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
finalContent = `${trimmedExisting}\n\n---\n\n${taskInfo}\n\nRun timestamp: ${timestamp}`;
```

This ensures each run creates genuinely unique content, even when appending to existing files.

### Solution 2: Fix Fork Mode Compare API (v0.29.9 - commit 072ca1d)

```javascript
// Construct correct head reference based on mode
let headRef;
if (argv.fork && forkedRepo) {
  const forkUser = forkedRepo.split('/')[0];
  headRef = `${forkUser}:${branchName}`;  // e.g., "konard:issue-678-abc"
} else {
  headRef = branchName;  // e.g., "issue-678-abc"
}
const compareResult = await $({ silent: true })`gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/compare/${targetBranchForCompare}...${headRef} --jq '.ahead_by' 2>&1`;
```

This matches the format used in `gh pr create` and correctly references branches in forks.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts Created

1. **`experiments/test-fork-compare-api-fix.mjs`** - Validates head reference construction
   - ✅ Non-fork mode: Uses simple branch name
   - ✅ Fork mode: Uses `forkUser:branch` format
   - ✅ Matches gh pr create format

2. **`experiments/investigate-no-commits-issue.mjs`** - Analysis script explaining the issue

3. **`experiments/test-real-scenario.sh`** - Reproduces the exact failure scenarios

All tests pass successfully.

## 🔍 Evidence & Logs

The case study includes three failure logs from production:

1. **log1.txt** (v0.29.5): First run creates branch, PR creation fails
2. **log2.txt** (v0.29.5): Second run with `--auto-continue` fails with "no commits"
3. **log3.txt** (v0.29.7): Fork mode fails with Compare API 404 errors

These logs prove that:
- v0.29.5 didn't have the timestamp fix → identical content → failures
- v0.29.7 didn't have fork mode fix → 404 errors → failures
- v0.29.9 (this PR) has both fixes → should work correctly

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### What This Fixes

✅ **PR creation in non-fork mode** with `--auto-continue`
✅ **PR creation in fork mode** with `--auto-fork`
✅ **Branch reuse** when retrying failed PR attempts
✅ **GitHub sync delay handling** for all modes
✅ **Consistency** between Compare API and PR creation

### What Remains Unchanged

✅ **First-time branch creation** - Works as before
✅ **Normal PR workflows** - No behavioral changes
✅ **Error messages** - Still helpful and clear
✅ **Performance** - Same retry timing

### No Side Effects

✅ CLAUDE.md is temporary (removed after session)
✅ Timestamp doesn't affect repository cleanliness
✅ Fork mode logic isolated from non-fork mode
✅ Backward compatible with all existing workflows

## 📊 Version Timeline

- **v0.29.5**: Original version, basic PR creation
- **v0.29.7**: Added Compare API check, inadvertently broke fork mode
- **v0.29.8**: Added timestamp fix for identical content
- **v0.29.9**: Fixed fork mode Compare API (this PR)

## ✨ Result

Users can now reliably use all solve command modes:
- ✅ Direct repository access
- ✅ Fork mode with `--auto-fork`
- ✅ Branch reuse with `--auto-continue`
- ✅ Combined fork + auto-continue workflows

The solve command now handles:
- GitHub's backend sync delays (exponential backoff retry)
- Content uniqueness when reusing branches (timestamp)
- Correct API references for fork mode (forkUser:branch format)
