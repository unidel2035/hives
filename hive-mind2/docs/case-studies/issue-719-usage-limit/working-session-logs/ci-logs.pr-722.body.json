{"body":"This PR addresses issue #719 by:\n\n- Handling usage-limit outcomes for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode by surfacing a dedicated PR comment with reset time and resume instructions when `--attach-logs` is used.\n- Ensuring the run is marked as failed so status reflects the failure rather than success.\n- Adding a case study with analysis under `docs/case-studies/issue-719/`.\n\nKey changes:\n- `src/solve.mjs`: Pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub` when a tool run fails due to usage limit; fall back to generic failure template otherwise.\n- `src/github.lib.mjs`: Dedicated \"Usage Limit Reached\" comment format incl. reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and optional attached logs.\n- `src/claude.lib.mjs`, `src/codex.lib.mjs`, `src/opencode.lib.mjs`: Robust usage-limit detection with reset time extraction and clear console messaging.\n\nCase study:\n- Overview and analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md`\n- Referenced logs: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/comment-3521528245.md` and JSON sources.\n\nFixes #719\n"}
