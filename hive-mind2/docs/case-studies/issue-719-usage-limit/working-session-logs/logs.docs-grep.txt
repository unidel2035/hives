So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached. So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHf5g","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"<synthetic>\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.

docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:1:# Case Study: Usage Limit Handling Across Tools (Issue #719)
docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:4:- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:5:- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.
docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:9:- 2025-11-12 11:47:04Z: Session starts. Error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 12:16 PM." (see issue body)
docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:19:- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:24:- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.
