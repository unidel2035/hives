So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached. So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","createdAt":"2025-11-12T12:32:15Z","number":719,"state":"OPEN","title":"Make sure we handle limit reached for all tools: claude, codex, opencode","updatedAt":"2025-11-13T04:00:00Z","url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/issues/719"}
