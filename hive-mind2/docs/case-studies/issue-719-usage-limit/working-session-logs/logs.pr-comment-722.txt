CI and local validation update:
- All required checks pass; merge state is CLEAN.
- PR description is up to date and references the added case-study docs and demo.
- Local lint passes (0 errors, 11 warnings; unchanged preexisting warnings).

Unless you want me to trim the warnings or add a small parser check, this is ready for review/merge.
