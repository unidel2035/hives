So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached. So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"\u003csynthetic\u003e\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.

ci-logs/pr-722.body.json:1:{"body":"This PR addresses issue #719 by:\n\n- Handling usage-limit outcomes for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode by surfacing a dedicated PR comment with reset time and resume instructions when `--attach-logs` is used.\n- Ensuring the run is marked as failed so status reflects the failure rather than success.\n- Adding a case study with analysis under `docs/case-studies/issue-719/` and `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/`.\n\nKey changes:\n- `src/solve.mjs`: Pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub` when a tool run fails due to usage limit; fall back to generic failure template otherwise.\n- `src/github.lib.mjs`: Dedicated \"Usage Limit Reached\" comment format incl. reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and optional attached logs.\n- `src/claude.lib.mjs`, `src/codex.lib.mjs`, `src/opencode.lib.mjs`: Robust usage-limit detection with reset time extraction and clear console messaging.\n- `src/solve.validation.lib.mjs`: Accepts reset time formats with or without space before AM/PM (e.g., `12:16 PM` or `12:16PM`) to support auto-continue.\n\nCase study:\n- Overview and analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/00-OVERVIEW.md`\n- Evidence and timeline: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/03-EVIDENCE.md`\n- Referenced logs: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/comment-3521528245.md` and JSON sources.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Added `experiments/parse-reset-time.mjs` to validate time parsing for auto-continue logic.\n\nFixes #719\n"}

logs/search-docs.txt:14:docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/00-OVERVIEW.md:11:The current implementation of AI tools (claude, codex, opencode) does not handle usage limit errors properly.

logs/search-docs.txt:299:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:19:- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
logs/search-docs.txt:300:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:24:- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

logs/12-pr722-comments.txt:47:Also fixed capturing of the usage limit reset time by assigning `global.limitResetTime` from the tool result in `src/solve.mjs`. This enables auto-continue messaging and PR comments to include the reset time as intended.
logs/12-pr722-comments.txt:61:Fixed usage-limit PR comment formatting and added sessionId to failure log uploads.\n\nChanges:\n- Treat isUsageLimit as primary condition in attachLogToGitHub (so usage-limit comments render even without a generic error message).\n- Include sessionId in failure attach to show it in the comment and resume instructions.\n\nPushed commit 7c17442. A new CI run is queued; I’ll monitor and review logs if anything fails.
logs/12-pr722-comments.txt:68:Small follow-up: fixed gist fallback to always use the Usage Limit comment when isUsageLimit=true. Previously it incorrectly required errorMessage to be set, which caused non-usage-limit formatting in some long-log cases. File: src/github.lib.mjs:656-704.
logs/12-pr722-comments.txt:76:- Confirmed usage-limit gist fallback in `src/github.lib.mjs:656` is active regardless of `errorMessage` when `isUsageLimit=true`.
logs/12-pr722-comments.txt:77:- Verified `src/solve.mjs` sets `global.limitResetTime` and passes `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, and `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`.
logs/search-pr-comment.txt:171:src/solve.mjs:824:          // For usage limit, use a dedicated comment format to make it clear and actionable
logs/search-pr-comment.txt:242:src/github.lib.mjs:515:    // Usage limit comments should be shown whenever isUsageLimit is true,
logs/25-grep-exitcode0.txt:4:docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/03-EVIDENCE.md:13:- 2025-11-13 03:54 UTC — Run detects session usage limit in Claude output; command previously returned exit code 0. PR comments added usage-limit detection and formatted messaging in tools and PR comments.

logs/pr-722.diff:592:+This document compiles concrete evidence, logs, and a reconstructed timeline for Issue #719: usage limit handling across tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode).
logs/pr-722.diff:599:+- 2025-11-12 12:32 UTC — Issue opened with logs showing: "You've hit your usage limit. … try again at 12:16 PM." (source issue body)
logs/pr-722.diff:600:+- 2025-11-13 03:54 UTC — Run detects session usage limit in Claude output; command previously returned exit code 0. PR comments added usage-limit detection and formatted messaging in tools and PR comments.
logs/pr-722.diff:625:+## Usage Limit Evidence (From Issue Logs)
logs/pr-722.diff:627:+User-provided logs demonstrate Anthropic usage limit pattern including reset time:
logs/pr-722.diff:630:+{"type":"error","message":"You've hit your usage limit. To get more access now, send a request to your admin or try again at 12:16 PM."}
logs/pr-722.diff:631:+{"type":"turn.failed","error":{"message":"You've hit your usage limit. To get more access now, send a request to your admin or try again at 12:16 PM."}}
logs/pr-722.diff:635:+- Detects usage limit via `detectUsageLimit(message)` with reset time extraction.
logs/pr-722.diff:636:+- Returns `{ success: false, limitReached: true, limitResetTime }` from tool executors.
logs/pr-722.diff:638:+- `attachLogToGitHub()` in `src/github.lib.mjs` formats a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" PR/issue comment including reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and log details when `--attach-logs` is used.
logs/pr-722.diff:670:+# Case Study: Usage Limit Handling Across Tools (Issue #719)
logs/pr-722.diff:673:+- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/pr-722.diff:674:+- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.
logs/pr-722.diff:678:+- 2025-11-12 11:47:04Z: Session starts. Error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 12:16 PM." (see issue body)
logs/pr-722.diff:679:+- 2025-11-13 03:54:27Z: Claude returns a result with `subtype: success` but `is_error: true` and text "Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am" (see related comment logs). The harness detected an error, but exit code remained 0 and comment formatting looked like success.
logs/pr-722.diff:688:+- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
logs/pr-722.diff:693:+- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHf5g","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"<synthetic>\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.

logs/pr-722.diff:6078:+docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:4:- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/pr-722.diff:6079:+docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:10:- 2025-11-13 03:54:27Z: Claude returns a result with `subtype: success` but `is_error: true` and text "Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am" (see related comment logs). The harness detected an error, but exit code remained 0 and comment formatting looked like success.

logs/pr-722.diff:6082:+docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:24:- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

fall back to generic failure template otherwise.\n- `src/github.lib.mjs`: Dedicated \"Usage Limit Reached\" comment format incl. reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and optional attached logs.\n- `src/claude.lib.mjs`, `src/codex.lib.mjs`, `src/opencode.lib.mjs`: Robust usage-limit detection with reset time extraction and clear console messaging.\n- `src/solve.validation.lib.mjs`: Accepts reset time formats with or without space before AM/PM (e.g., `12:16 PM` or `12:16PM`) to support auto-continue.\n\nCase study:\n- Overview and analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/00-OVERVIEW.md`\n- Evidence and timeline: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/03-EVIDENCE.md`\n- Referenced logs: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/comment-3521528245.md` and JSON sources.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Added `experiments/parse-reset-time.mjs` to validate time parsing for auto-continue logic.\n\nFixes #719\n","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-11-13T04:01:10Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-11-13T04:01:10Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/issues/719","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #719","oid":"33e31b46878c9829a523979c7ef8c91beea048f7"},{"authoredDate":"2025-11-13T04:04:18Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-11-13T04:04:18Z","messageBody":"… issue #719\\n\\n- When tool run fails due to usage limit, attach PR comment using dedicated usage-limit template with reset time + resume command\\n- Preserve non-zero exit for clear failure signaling\\n- Add docs/case-studies/issue-719 with referenced logs and analysis","messageHeadline":"feat: proper usage-limit handling for PR comments;

logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:728:+This document compiles concrete evidence, logs, and a reconstructed timeline for Issue #719: usage limit handling across tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode).

logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:771:+- Detects usage limit via `detectUsageLimit(message)` with reset time extraction.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:772:+- Returns `{ success: false, limitReached: true, limitResetTime }` from tool executors.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:774:+- `attachLogToGitHub()` in `src/github.lib.mjs` formats a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" PR/issue comment including reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and log details when `--attach-logs` is used.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:806:+# Case Study: Usage Limit Handling Across Tools (Issue #719)
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:809:+- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:810:+- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:814:+- 2025-11-12 11:47:04Z: Session starts. Error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 12:16 PM." (see issue body)
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:815:+- 2025-11-13 03:54:27Z: Claude returns a result with `subtype: success` but `is_error: true` and text "Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am" (see related comment logs). The harness detected an error, but exit code remained 0 and comment formatting looked like success.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:824:+- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:829:+- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached. So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHf5g","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"<synthetic>\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.

logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1348:+# Case Study: Usage Limit Handling Across Tools (Issue #719)
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1351:+- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1352:+- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1356:+- 2025-11-12 11:47:04Z: Session starts. Error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 12:16 PM." (see issue body)
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1357:+- 2025-11-13 03:54:27Z: Claude returns a result with `subtype: success` but `is_error: true` and text "Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am" (see related comment logs). The harness detected an error, but exit code remained 0 and comment formatting looked like success.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1366:+- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:1371:+- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached.

logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:9898:+docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:4:- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:9899:+docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:5:- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.

logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17130:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3041:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:4:- Problem: When usage limits are reached for AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenCode), the run was surfaced as a success comment with exit code 0, confusing users. PR comments also lacked a clear “limit reached” message and reset-time guidance.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17131:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3042:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:5:- Impact: Users had to dig into logs to discover rate/usage limits. Comment formatting did not distinguish usage-limit from generic failures.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17133:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3044:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:9:- 2025-11-12 11:47:04Z: Session starts. Error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at 12:16 PM." (see issue body)
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17134:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3045:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:10:- 2025-11-13 03:54:27Z: Claude returns a result with `subtype: success` but `is_error: true` and text "Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am" (see related comment logs). The harness detected an error, but exit code remained 0 and comment formatting looked like success.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17136:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3047:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:19:- The tool libraries (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) already detect usage limits and expose `limitReached` and `limitResetTime`.
logs/40-pr-diff-722.txt:17138:+logs.search-keywords.txt:3049:docs/case-studies/issue-719/case-study.md:24:- In `src/solve.mjs`, when a tool run fails, pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and a `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub`. This triggers a dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment with reset-time and clear resume instructions. Generic `errorMessage` is sent only when not a usage-limit case.

So the form of comment markdown should separate for that, but similar to failed.\n\nAnd it also should contain log if we asked to --attach-logs.\n\nSo the user should have easy to read and find message about limit reached. So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHf5g","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"<synthetic>\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.

So we will save time for the user not to go to logs.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHf5g","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"```\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.301Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"id\": \"79ba1466-909b-4b90-95cf-d6c9052fb790\",\n    \"container\": null,\n    \"model\": \"<synthetic>\",\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"stop_reason\": \"stop_sequence\",\n    \"stop_sequence\": \"\",\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"output_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"server_tool_use\": {\n        \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n        \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n      },\n      \"service_tier\": null,\n      \"cache_creation\": {\n        \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n        \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"context_management\": null\n  },\n  \"parent_tool_use_id\": null,\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"uuid\": \"7ee889aa-b2e7-4828-8fed-8143a176e09a\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.302Z] [INFO] {\n  \"type\": \"result\",\n  \"subtype\": \"success\",\n  \"is_error\": true,\n  \"duration_ms\": 26660,\n  \"duration_api_ms\": 60865,\n  \"num_turns\": 10,\n  \"result\": \"Weekly limit reached ∙ resets 5am\",\n  \"session_id\": \"64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\",\n  \"total_cost_usd\": 0.14746179999999998,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"input_tokens\": 17,\n    \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 19624,\n    \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 58446,\n    \"output_tokens\": 800,\n    \"server_tool_use\": {\n      \"web_search_requests\": 0,\n      \"web_fetch_requests\": 0\n    },\n    \"service_tier\": \"standard\",\n    \"cache_creation\": {\n      \"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\": 0,\n      \"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\": 19624\n    }\n  },\n  \"modelUsage\": {\n    \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 7209,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2120,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 0,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.017809,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    },\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\": {\n      \"inputTokens\": 858,\n      \"outputTokens\": 2397,\n      \"cacheReadInputTokens\": 58446,\n      \"cacheCreationInputTokens\": 19624,\n      \"webSearchRequests\": 0,\n      \"costUSD\": 0.12965279999999998,\n      \"contextWindow\": 200000\n    }\n  },\n  \"permission_denials\": [],\n  \"uuid\": \"ee1192d0-1437-4687-a704-6d27ccb47644\"\n}\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] 💰 Anthropic official cost captured: $0.147462\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.304Z] [INFO] ⚠️ Detected session limit in result\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.502Z] [ERROR] \n\n❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.503Z] [INFO] 📌 Session ID for resuming: 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO] \nTo resume this session, run:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.504Z] [INFO]    /home/hive/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.5/bin/node /home/hive/.bun/bin/solve undefined --resume 64652bfd-65f5-460f-bb16-fa89fa8fc778\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.537Z] [INFO] \n📈 System resources after execution:\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Memory: MemFree:          849168 kB\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.538Z] [INFO]    Load: 0.18 0.29 0.32 1/435 806272\n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n[2025-11-13T03:54:27.539Z] [INFO] \n📄 Attaching failure logs to Pull Request...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/konard/hh-questions/pull/30#issuecomment-3525165717 - comment is here.\n\nWe didn't handle properly weekly limit reach for claude tool.
