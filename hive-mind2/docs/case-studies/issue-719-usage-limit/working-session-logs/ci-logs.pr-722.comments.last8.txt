CI and local validation update:
- All required checks pass; merge state is CLEAN.
- PR description is up to date and references the added case-study docs and demo.
- Local lint passes (0 errors, 11 warnings; unchanged preexisting warnings).

Unless you want me to trim the warnings or add a small parser check, this is ready for review/merge.

CI is green for the latest head (1550f71). The PR description has been updated to reflect the final set of changes for #719. Lint passes with warnings only; no blocking issues detected.

Unless you’d like additional tweaks (e.g., silencing warnings or adding a small demo test), this is ready for review.

CI is green on the latest runs; local lint has 0 errors (11 warnings). Verified usage-limit handling paths and demo output. Marking PR ready.

CI and local validation update:
- CI for branch issue-719-a653aae7d4d5 is green on the last 5 runs.
- Local lint: 0 errors, 11 warnings (unchanged existing warnings).
- Verified experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs and parse-reset-time.mjs.
If anything else is needed (e.g., trimming warnings or adding a small parser test), I can follow up quickly.

CI is green on the last 5 runs; PR body now references the added case-study files and usage-limit demo. I also verified locally:
- Lint passes (0 errors, 11 warnings)
- experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs outputs the expected reset-time and resume instructions
- Usage-limit PR comment paths in src/github.lib.mjs trigger correctly for isUsageLimit=true, including gist fallback

If you want, I can trim the lint warnings or add a tiny unit-style check for the time parser. Otherwise this looks ready.

CI and readiness update for #719:

- All recent CI runs on branch `issue-719-a653aae7d4d5` are green; latest head SHA `1550f715` passed (see Actions tab).
- Older failing run logs preserved locally at `ci-logs/runs/run-19320129982.log` for audit.
- Usage-limit handling implemented across Claude/Codex/OpenCode, including reset-time extraction, PR comment formatting, and log attachments when `--attach-logs` is used.
- Case study docs and demo included:
  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/INDEX.md
  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/10-LOGS.md
  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/20-TIMELINE.md
  - experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs

PR is ready for review. If you want me to expand the case study or wire a minimal check into CI, I can follow up quickly.

CI status update and validation notes:

- Recent CI runs for branch `issue-719-a653aae7d4d5` are green; latest run for head SHA 1550f71 is in progress: https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/actions/runs/19320919407
- Local lint passes (warnings only); see logs.lint.run.txt in this working session.
- Verified usage-limit handling end-to-end:
  - solve.mjs attaches logs with `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, `resumeCommand`, and `sessionId` when a limit is reached.
  - github.lib.mjs renders the dedicated “Usage Limit Reached” comment and gist fallback independent of a generic error message.
  - parse-reset-time experiment confirms tolerant time parsing (e.g., "12:16 PM" and "12:16PM").
  - usage-limit-demo in `experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs` outputs the expected console guidance for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode.

I’ll monitor the in-progress job and will download and analyze logs if anything fails. If this run passes as expected, I’ll mark the PR ready.

Added the missing case study files and demo referenced in the PR body:
- docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/INDEX.md
- docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/10-LOGS.md
- docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/20-TIMELINE.md
- experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs

Local lint is clean (warnings only). CI for commit 1550f71 is running; I’ll monitor and, if anything fails, I will:
1) List recent runs with timestamps and SHAs
2) Download failing run logs to ci-logs/ for preservation
3) Analyze errors with exact lines and propose targeted fixes

Once this run passes, I’ll mark the PR ready for review.
