This PR addresses issue #719 by:

- Handling usage-limit outcomes for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode by surfacing a dedicated PR comment with reset time and resume instructions when `--attach-logs` is used.
- Ensuring the run is marked as failed so status reflects the failure rather than success.
- Adding a case study with analysis under `docs/case-studies/issue-719/` and `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/`.

Key changes:
- `src/solve.mjs`: Pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub` when a tool run fails due to usage limit; fall back to generic failure template otherwise.
- `src/github.lib.mjs`: Dedicated "Usage Limit Reached" comment format incl. reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and optional attached logs.
- `src/claude.lib.mjs`, `src/codex.lib.mjs`, `src/opencode.lib.mjs`: Robust usage-limit detection with reset time extraction and clear console messaging.
- `src/solve.validation.lib.mjs`: Accepts reset time formats with or without space before AM/PM (e.g., `12:16 PM` or `12:16PM`) to support auto-continue.

Case study:
- Overview and analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/00-OVERVIEW.md`
- Evidence and timeline: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/03-EVIDENCE.md`
- Referenced logs: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/comment-3521528245.md` and JSON sources.

Additional notes:
- Added `experiments/parse-reset-time.mjs` to validate time parsing for auto-continue logic.

Fixes #719
