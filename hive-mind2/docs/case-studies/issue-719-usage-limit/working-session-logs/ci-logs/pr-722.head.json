{"baseRefName":"main","body":"This PR addresses issue #719 by:\n\n- Handling usage-limit outcomes for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode by surfacing a dedicated PR comment with reset time and resume instructions when `--attach-logs` is used.\n- Ensuring the run is marked as failed so status reflects the failure rather than success.\n- Adding a case study with analysis under `docs/case-studies/issue-719/` and `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/`.\n\nKey changes:\n- `src/solve.mjs`: Pass `isUsageLimit`, `limitResetTime`, `toolName`, and `resumeCommand` to `attachLogToGitHub` when a tool run fails due to usage limit; fall back to generic failure template otherwise.\n- `src/github.lib.mjs`: Dedicated \"Usage Limit Reached\" comment format incl. reset time, session ID, resume instructions, and optional attached logs.\n- `src/claude.lib.mjs`, `src/codex.lib.mjs`, `src/opencode.lib.mjs`: Robust usage-limit detection with reset time extraction and clear console messaging.\n- `src/solve.validation.lib.mjs`: Accepts reset time formats with or without space before AM/PM (e.g., `12:16 PM` or `12:16PM`) to support auto-continue.\n\nCase study:\n- Overview and analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/00-OVERVIEW.md`\n- Evidence and timeline: `docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/03-EVIDENCE.md`\n- Referenced logs: `docs/case-studies/issue-719/comment-3521528245.md` and JSON sources.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Added `experiments/parse-reset-time.mjs` to validate time parsing for auto-continue logic.\n\nFixes #719\n","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHlcC","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"## 🤖 Solution Draft Log\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\n💰 **Cost estimation:**\n- Public pricing estimate: unknown\n- Calculated by Anthropic: unknown\n- Difference: unknown\n📎 **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (1426KB)\n🔗 [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.github.com/konard/4d916545732bcdc2def78bedc62fe1e1)\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","createdAt":"2025-11-13T04:04:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/pull/722#issuecomment-3525203714","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SHlmn","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"## 🔄 Auto-restart 1/3\n\nDetected uncommitted changes from previous run.
