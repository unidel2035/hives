If this run passes as expected, I’ll mark the PR ready.\n","createdAt":"2025-11-13T04:55:31Z","id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7SIOUR","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/pull/722#issuecomment-3525371153","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"CI and readiness update for #719:\n\n- All recent CI runs on branch `issue-719-a653aae7d4d5` are green; latest head SHA `1550f715` passed (see Actions tab).\n- Older failing run logs preserved locally at `ci-logs/runs/run-19320129982.log` for audit.\n- Usage-limit handling implemented across Claude/Codex/OpenCode, including reset-time extraction, PR comment formatting, and log attachments when `--attach-logs` is used.\n- Case study docs and demo included:\n  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/INDEX.md\n  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/10-LOGS.md\n  - docs/case-studies/issue-719-usage-limit/20-TIMELINE.md\n  - experiments/usage-limit-demo.mjs\n\nPR is ready for review.
