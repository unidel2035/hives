Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented CD (Continuous Deployment) for the `test-anywhere` package to publish to NPM when all tests pass. Here's what was done:\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**1. Created `.github/workflows/publish.yml`**\n   - Triggers only on pushes to `main` branch when `package.json` changes\n   - Runs all tests across Node.js, Bun, and Deno in parallel using a matrix strategy\n   - Only publishes to NPM after all test jobs complete successfully (using `needs: test`)\n   - Uses `NPM_TOKEN` secret for authentication with NPM registry\n\n**2. Updated `package.json`**\n   - Bumped version from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` to prepare for the next release\n   - This version bump will trigger the CD workflow when merged to main\n\n**3. Testing & Verification**\n   - All local tests pass (6/6 tests passing)\n   - All CI checks pass on the PR (Node.js, Bun, Deno)\n   - Workflow follows the same style as existing `test.yml` workflow\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. When a PR with `package.json` changes is merged to `main`, the workflow triggers\n2. Three test jobs run in parallel (one for each runtime: Node.js, Bun, Deno)\n3. Only if all tests pass, the `publish` job runs\n4. The package is published to NPM with public access\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBefore the workflow can successfully publish, a repository administrator needs to:\n1. Generate an NPM access token with publish permissions\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**\n\n### Pull Request\n\nThe solution is ready for review at: **https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/pull/4**\n\nAll tasks have been completed successfully and the PR is marked as ready for review!"

Created `.github/workflows/publish.yml`**\n   - Triggers only on pushes to `main` branch when `package.json` changes\n   - Runs all tests across Node.js, Bun, and Deno in parallel using a matrix strategy\n   - Only publishes to NPM after all test jobs complete successfully (using `needs: test`)\n   - Uses `NPM_TOKEN` secret for authentication with NPM registry\n\n**2. Updated `package.json`**\n   - Bumped version from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` to prepare for the next release\n   - This version bump will trigger the CD workflow when merged to main\n\n**3. Testing & Verification**\n   - All local tests pass (6/6 tests passing)\n   - All CI checks pass on the PR (Node.js, Bun, Deno)\n   - Workflow follows the same style as existing `test.yml` workflow\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. When a PR with `package.json` changes is merged to `main`, the workflow triggers\n2. Three test jobs run in parallel (one for each runtime: Node.js, Bun, Deno)\n3. Only if all tests pass, the `publish` job runs\n4. The package is published to NPM with public access\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBefore the workflow can successfully publish, a repository administrator needs to:\n1. Generate an NPM access token with publish permissions\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**\n\n### Pull Request\n\nThe solution is ready for review at: **https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/pull/4**\n\nAll tasks have been completed successfully and the PR is marked as ready for review!",

On every push to `main` or PR, all three test jobs (Node.js, Bun, Deno) run in parallel\n2.

Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --branch issue-1-06e1c096 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \"failing\" but tools show \"passing\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/issues/1.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner konard [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need latest comments on pull request (sorted newest first), use appropriate GitHub API commands.\n   - When you need latest comments on issue (sorted newest first), use appropriate GitHub API commands.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 2 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 2, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 2.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-1-06e1c096.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-1-06e1c096. (Note: PR 2 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-1-06e1c096.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 2 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nIssue to solve: https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/issues/1\nYour prepared branch: issue-1-06e1c096\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762008239822\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/pull/2\n\nProceed.","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

When no plain `Request` or `WebSocket` parameter was found, the code would add a synthetic `___dishka_request` parameter of type `Request`\n2. This synthetic parameter was used to access the dishka container via `.state.dishka_container`\n3. However, WebSocket handlers receive `WebSocket` objects from FastAPI, not `Request` objects\n4. When the injected function tried to access `kwargs[\"___dishka_request\"].state.dishka_container`, it failed with a KeyError because FastAPI never provided a `___dishka_request` parameter to WebSocket handlers\n\nThe original attempt to fix this by modifying `_find_request_param()` was treating the symptom rather than the root cause, as pointed out in the code review feedback.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix detects whether the function is a WebSocket handler by checking if it has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies:\n\n1. Added a new `_needs_websocket_param()` function that checks if any `FromDishka` dependencies are of type `WebSocket`\n2. Created a new `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` synthetic parameter (in addition to the existing `DISHKA_REQUEST_PARAM`)\n3. Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to choose the appropriate synthetic parameter:\n   - If the function has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies, add `___dishka_websocket: WebSocket`\n   - Otherwise, add `___dishka_request: Request`\n4. Both Request and WebSocket objects have `.state.dishka_container`, so the container access works correctly\n\n## Changes\n\n- **src/dishka/integrations/fastapi.py**: \n  - Added `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` constant\n  - Added `_needs_websocket_param()` helper function\n  - Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to detect WebSocket handlers and add the appropriate parameter\n  - Added imports for `get_args` and `get_origin` from typing\n- **tests/integrations/fastapi/test_fastapi_websockets.py**: Added regression test `test_fromdishka_websocket_only()`\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded a new test case that reproduces the original issue:\n\n```python\nasync def get_with_fromdishka_websocket_only(\n    ws: FromDishka[WebSocket],\n    mock: FromDishka[Mock],\n) -\u003e None:\n    await ws.accept()\n    await ws.receive()\n    mock(\"ok\")\n    await ws.send_text(\"passed\")\n```\n\nThis test verifies that handlers can use `FromDishka[WebSocket]` without requiring a plain `WebSocket` parameter.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/reagento/dishka/issues/575","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #575","oid":"5ec21e248a109ba320b7e7c6ac812a1d70b8990d"},{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","messageBody":"… parameter\n\nThe issue occurred when _find_request_param() found parameters marked with\nFromDishka (e.g., FromDishka[WebSocket]) and tried to use them to access\nthe container.

Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nThis is a **hh.ru Job Application Automation** tool written in Node.js that automates the process of sending job applications with custom messages. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Textarea Message Typing**\n\nThe code that types messages into the textarea is located in **TWO places** (one for each browser automation library):\n\n### Playwright Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` (Lines 269-271)\n```javascript\nconst textarea = page.locator('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait textarea.click();\nawait textarea.type(MESSAGE);\n```\n\n### Puppeteer Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` (Lines 272-274)\n```javascript\nawait page.waitForSelector('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', { visible: true });\nawait page.click('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait page.type('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', MESSAGE);\n```\n\n**Key Details:**\n- Targets the textarea with `data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"`\n- The MESSAGE variable is defined at lines 93-100 in both files\n- Both versions verify the typed message matches before submission\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Job Application Handling**\n\nThe job application logic is in both main files and follows this flow:\n\n### Main Application Loop:\n**Both Files** (lines 199-298)\n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. **Finds \"Откликнуться\" buttons** - Russian text meaning \"Respond\" or \"Apply\"\n   - Playwright: `page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Откликнуться' })`\n   - Puppeteer: Searches through all links for exact text match\n\n2. **Handles Navigation/Modal:** Uses `Promise.race()` to handle both redirect and modal popup scenarios\n\n3. **Adds Cover Letter:** Clicks \"Добавить сопроводительное\" (Add Cover Letter)\n\n4. **Fills Form:** Clicks textarea and types the message\n\n5. **Submits:** Clicks the submit button `[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-submit-popup\"]`\n\n6. **Waits Between Applications:** Respects the `--job-application-interval` flag (default 20 seconds)\n\n7. **Handles Redirects:** If a separate form page appears, waits for user to complete it manually and return\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Main Entry Points and Application Structure**\n\n### **Two Entry Points:**\n\n1. **Playwright Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Playwright browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run playwright`\n\n2. **Puppeteer Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Puppeteer browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run puppeteer`\n\n3. **In-Browser DevTools Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js`\n   - Lightweight version to paste into browser console\n   - Demonstrates the core clicking logic\n\n### **Application Structure:**\n\n```\nMain Flow:\n1. Parse CLI arguments (yargs)\n   - --url: Target URL (job search page)\n   - --manual-login: Enable manual login\n   - --job-application-interval: Seconds between applications\n   - --user-data-dir: Persistent session storage\n\n2. Setup Browser\n   - Launch with persistent user data directory\n   - Disable translation, infobars, crash restore popups\n   - Load cookies/session from previous runs\n\n3. Handle Login\n   - If --manual-login: Show login page and wait for redirect\n   - Otherwise: Navigate directly to URL\n\n4. Main Automation Loop\n   ├─ Find all \"Откликнуться\" buttons\n   ├─ Click first button\n   ├─ Wait for modal form\n   ├─ Click \"Добавить сопроводительное\"\n   ├─ Type message in textarea\n   ├─ Click submit button\n   ├─ Wait for interval\n   └─ Repeat until no more buttons\n\n5. Graceful Shutdown\n   - Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM\n   - Detect user closing browser tab\n   - Close browser safely\n```\n\n### **Key Configuration:**\n- **Default Message** (lines 93-100): Customizable via `MESSAGE` env variable or hardcoded default (Russian text asking about remote work arrangements and GitHub links)\n- **Default URL:** `https://hh.ru/search/vacancy?from=resumelist`\n- **Default Interval:** 20 seconds between applications\n- **Session Storage:** `~/.hh-automation/playwright-data` or `~/.hh-automation/puppeteer-data`\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Important Files Summary**\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Playwright |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Puppeteer |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js` | Browser console script for manual testing |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/eslint.config.js` | Linting configuration |"

Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nThis is a **hh.ru Job Application Automation** tool written in Node.js that automates the process of sending job applications with custom messages. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Textarea Message Typing**\n\nThe code that types messages into the textarea is located in **TWO places** (one for each browser automation library):\n\n### Playwright Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` (Lines 269-271)\n```javascript\nconst textarea = page.locator('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait textarea.click();\nawait textarea.type(MESSAGE);\n```\n\n### Puppeteer Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` (Lines 272-274)\n```javascript\nawait page.waitForSelector('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', { visible: true });\nawait page.click('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait page.type('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', MESSAGE);\n```\n\n**Key Details:**\n- Targets the textarea with `data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"`\n- The MESSAGE variable is defined at lines 93-100 in both files\n- Both versions verify the typed message matches before submission\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Job Application Handling**\n\nThe job application logic is in both main files and follows this flow:\n\n### Main Application Loop:\n**Both Files** (lines 199-298)\n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. **Finds \"Откликнуться\" buttons** - Russian text meaning \"Respond\" or \"Apply\"\n   - Playwright: `page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Откликнуться' })`\n   - Puppeteer: Searches through all links for exact text match\n\n2. **Handles Navigation/Modal:** Uses `Promise.race()` to handle both redirect and modal popup scenarios\n\n3. **Adds Cover Letter:** Clicks \"Добавить сопроводительное\" (Add Cover Letter)\n\n4. **Fills Form:** Clicks textarea and types the message\n\n5. **Submits:** Clicks the submit button `[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-submit-popup\"]`\n\n6. **Waits Between Applications:** Respects the `--job-application-interval` flag (default 20 seconds)\n\n7. **Handles Redirects:** If a separate form page appears, waits for user to complete it manually and return\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Main Entry Points and Application Structure**\n\n### **Two Entry Points:**\n\n1. **Playwright Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Playwright browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run playwright`\n\n2. **Puppeteer Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Puppeteer browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run puppeteer`\n\n3. **In-Browser DevTools Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js`\n   - Lightweight version to paste into browser console\n   - Demonstrates the core clicking logic\n\n### **Application Structure:**\n\n```\nMain Flow:\n1. Parse CLI arguments (yargs)\n   - --url: Target URL (job search page)\n   - --manual-login: Enable manual login\n   - --job-application-interval: Seconds between applications\n   - --user-data-dir: Persistent session storage\n\n2. Setup Browser\n   - Launch with persistent user data directory\n   - Disable translation, infobars, crash restore popups\n   - Load cookies/session from previous runs\n\n3. Handle Login\n   - If --manual-login: Show login page and wait for redirect\n   - Otherwise: Navigate directly to URL\n\n4. Main Automation Loop\n   ├─ Find all \"Откликнуться\" buttons\n   ├─ Click first button\n   ├─ Wait for modal form\n   ├─ Click \"Добавить сопроводительное\"\n   ├─ Type message in textarea\n   ├─ Click submit button\n   ├─ Wait for interval\n   └─ Repeat until no more buttons\n\n5. Graceful Shutdown\n   - Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM\n   - Detect user closing browser tab\n   - Close browser safely\n```\n\n### **Key Configuration:**\n- **Default Message** (lines 93-100): Customizable via `MESSAGE` env variable or hardcoded default (Russian text asking about remote work arrangements and GitHub links)\n- **Default URL:** `https://hh.ru/search/vacancy?from=resumelist`\n- **Default Interval:** 20 seconds between applications\n- **Session Storage:** `~/.hh-automation/playwright-data` or `~/.hh-automation/puppeteer-data`\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Important Files Summary**\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Playwright |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Puppeteer |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js` | Browser console script for manual testing |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/eslint.config.js` | Linting configuration |"

Have clear, version-specific titles (e.g., \"chore: version packages (v0.3.0)\")\n2. Automatically include synchronized package-lock.json updates\n3.

When no plain `Request` or `WebSocket` parameter was found, the code would add a synthetic `___dishka_request` parameter of type `Request`\n2. This synthetic parameter was used to access the dishka container via `.state.dishka_container`\n3. However, WebSocket handlers receive `WebSocket` objects from FastAPI, not `Request` objects\n4. When the injected function tried to access `kwargs[\"___dishka_request\"].state.dishka_container`, it failed with a KeyError because FastAPI never provided a `___dishka_request` parameter to WebSocket handlers\n\nThe original attempt to fix this by modifying `_find_request_param()` was treating the symptom rather than the root cause, as pointed out in the code review feedback.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix detects whether the function is a WebSocket handler by checking if it has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies:\n\n1. Added a new `_needs_websocket_param()` function that checks if any `FromDishka` dependencies are of type `WebSocket`\n2. Created a new `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` synthetic parameter (in addition to the existing `DISHKA_REQUEST_PARAM`)\n3. Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to choose the appropriate synthetic parameter:\n   - If the function has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies, add `___dishka_websocket: WebSocket`\n   - Otherwise, add `___dishka_request: Request`\n4. Both Request and WebSocket objects have `.state.dishka_container`, so the container access works correctly\n\n## Changes\n\n- **src/dishka/integrations/fastapi.py**: \n  - Added `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` constant\n  - Added `_needs_websocket_param()` helper function\n  - Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to detect WebSocket handlers and add the appropriate parameter\n  - Added imports for `get_args` and `get_origin` from typing\n- **tests/integrations/fastapi/test_fastapi_websockets.py**: Added regression test `test_fromdishka_websocket_only()`\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded a new test case that reproduces the original issue:\n\n```python\nasync def get_with_fromdishka_websocket_only(\n    ws: FromDishka[WebSocket],\n    mock: FromDishka[Mock],\n) -\u003e None:\n    await ws.accept()\n    await ws.receive()\n    mock(\"ok\")\n    await ws.send_text(\"passed\")\n```\n\nThis test verifies that handlers can use `FromDishka[WebSocket]` without requiring a plain `WebSocket` parameter.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/reagento/dishka/issues/575","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #575","oid":"5ec21e248a109ba320b7e7c6ac812a1d70b8990d"},{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","messageBody":"… parameter\n\nThe issue occurred when _find_request_param() found parameters marked with\nFromDishka (e.g., FromDishka[WebSocket]) and tried to use them to access\nthe container.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Updating PR Title with Changesets Action\n\nThe pull request title can be customized using the `title` parameter in the changesets action configuration. The default title is \"Version Packages\".\n\nHere's how to configure it in your GitHub workflow:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Create Release Pull Request\n  uses: changesets/action@v1\n  with:\n    title: \"chore: update versions\"  # Custom PR title\n    commit: \"chore: update versions\"  # Custom commit message\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThe pnpm documentation shows an example using `title: \"chore: update versions\"` as a configuration option.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe automatically created PR will contain all changes from the contributor plus a new commit that bumps the version and updates CHANGELOG.md. While the default title is generic, you can customize it to include specific text, though the version number itself is typically shown in the PR body and changelog rather than the title.\n\nIf you want to dynamically include the actual version number in the PR title, you would need to create a custom script or use additional GitHub Actions steps to extract the version from `package.json` and update the PR title programmatically using the GitHub API."

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n## Changesets and package-lock.json Updates\n\nWhen using npm, running `changeset version` does not update the version in the lock file. This is a known issue documented in the Changesets GitHub repository.\n\n### The Solution\n\nRunning `npm install` ensures that the version is updated in the package-lock.json file after running `changeset version`. This does not appear to have any ill effect and may be purely cosmetic.\n\n### Similar Issue with pnpm\n\nThis same problem exists with pnpm as well. When using pnpm with changesets in a monorepo, after merging the \"Update Versions\" PR from the changesets action, CI breaks on the \"Install\" step since changesets has updated the versions in linked packages but has not updated the pnpm-lock.yaml.\n\n### How npm Handles package-lock.json Updates\n\npackage-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.\n\n### Best Practice\n\nAfter running `changeset version` to bump your package versions, you should run `npm install` to ensure the package-lock.json file is updated to reflect the new versions."

On every push to `main` or PR, all three test jobs (Node.js, Bun, Deno) run in parallel\\n2. On `main` branch pushes, if all tests pass, the publish job runs (due to `needs: [test-node, test-bun, test-deno]`)\\n3. The publish job checks if the current version in `package.json` is already published on NPM\\n4. Only if the version is not published yet, the package is published to NPM with public access\\n5. If the version already exists, publishing is skipped with a message\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore this workflow can successfully publish, a repository administrator needs to:\\n1. Generate an NPM access token with publish permissions\\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\n- All existing tests pass locally and in CI\\n- Workflow YAML syntax is valid\\n- Publishing step will be tested on first merge to main with a new version number\\n\\nFixes #3\\n\\n---\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\",\"comments\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"konard\"},\"authorAssociation\":\"MEMBER\",\"body\":\"🤖 **AI Work Session Started**\\n\\nStarting automated work session at 2025-10-25T06:30:17.888Z\\n\\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\\n\\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.

When a PR is merged to `main` that changes `package.json`, the workflow triggers\\n2. All three test jobs (Node.js, Bun, Deno) run in parallel\\n3. Only if all tests pass, the `publish` job runs (due to `needs: test`)\\n4. The package is published to NPM with public access\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore this workflow can successfully publish, a repository administrator needs to:\\n1. Generate an NPM access token with publish permissions\\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\n- All existing tests pass locally and in CI\\n- Workflow YAML syntax is valid\\n- Publishing step will be tested on first merge to main\\n\\nFixes #3\\n\\n---\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\",\"comments\":[{\"author\":\"konard\",\"body\":\"## 🤖 Solution Draft Log\\n\\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\\n\\n📎 **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (138KB)\\n🔗 [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.github.com/konard/b1d5083bdb3297d8013ced7ee0a3104f)\\n\\n---\\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*\",\"createdAt\":\"2025-10-15T04:39:42Z\"},{\"author\":\"konard\",\"body\":\"We need to have single CI\\u0026CD, where publish only executed if no current version is published and all tests have passed.\",\"createdAt\":\"2025-10-15T14:34:46Z\"},{\"author\":\"konard\",\"body\":\"🤖 **AI Work Session Started**\\n\\nStarting automated work session at 2025-10-15T14:35:46.217Z\\n\\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\\n\\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.

Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --branch issue-1-06e1c096 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \"failing\" but tools show \"passing\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/issues/1.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner konard [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need latest comments on pull request (sorted newest first), use appropriate GitHub API commands.\n   - When you need latest comments on issue (sorted newest first), use appropriate GitHub API commands.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 2 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4 --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 2, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 2.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-1-06e1c096.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-1-06e1c096. (Note: PR 2 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-1-06e1c096.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 2 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nIssue to solve: https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/issues/1\nYour prepared branch: issue-1-06e1c096\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762008239822\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/konard/test-hello-world-019a3fde-15cf-7144-a220-5f92e04d1bb4/pull/2\n\nProceed.","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

When no plain `Request` or `WebSocket` parameter was found, the code would add a synthetic `___dishka_request` parameter of type `Request`\n2. This synthetic parameter was used to access the dishka container via `.state.dishka_container`\n3. However, WebSocket handlers receive `WebSocket` objects from FastAPI, not `Request` objects\n4. When the injected function tried to access `kwargs[\"___dishka_request\"].state.dishka_container`, it failed with a KeyError because FastAPI never provided a `___dishka_request` parameter to WebSocket handlers\n\nThe original attempt to fix this by modifying `_find_request_param()` was treating the symptom rather than the root cause, as pointed out in the code review feedback.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix detects whether the function is a WebSocket handler by checking if it has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies:\n\n1. Added a new `_needs_websocket_param()` function that checks if any `FromDishka` dependencies are of type `WebSocket`\n2. Created a new `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` synthetic parameter (in addition to the existing `DISHKA_REQUEST_PARAM`)\n3. Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to choose the appropriate synthetic parameter:\n   - If the function has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies, add `___dishka_websocket: WebSocket`\n   - Otherwise, add `___dishka_request: Request`\n4. Both Request and WebSocket objects have `.state.dishka_container`, so the container access works correctly\n\n## Changes\n\n- **src/dishka/integrations/fastapi.py**: \n  - Added `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` constant\n  - Added `_needs_websocket_param()` helper function\n  - Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to detect WebSocket handlers and add the appropriate parameter\n  - Added imports for `get_args` and `get_origin` from typing\n- **tests/integrations/fastapi/test_fastapi_websockets.py**: Added regression test `test_fromdishka_websocket_only()`\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded a new test case that reproduces the original issue:\n\n```python\nasync def get_with_fromdishka_websocket_only(\n    ws: FromDishka[WebSocket],\n    mock: FromDishka[Mock],\n) -\u003e None:\n    await ws.accept()\n    await ws.receive()\n    mock(\"ok\")\n    await ws.send_text(\"passed\")\n```\n\nThis test verifies that handlers can use `FromDishka[WebSocket]` without requiring a plain `WebSocket` parameter.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/reagento/dishka/issues/575","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #575","oid":"5ec21e248a109ba320b7e7c6ac812a1d70b8990d"},{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","messageBody":"… parameter\n\nThe issue occurred when _find_request_param() found parameters marked with\nFromDishka (e.g., FromDishka[WebSocket]) and tried to use them to access\nthe container.

Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nThis is a **hh.ru Job Application Automation** tool written in Node.js that automates the process of sending job applications with custom messages. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Textarea Message Typing**\n\nThe code that types messages into the textarea is located in **TWO places** (one for each browser automation library):\n\n### Playwright Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` (Lines 269-271)\n```javascript\nconst textarea = page.locator('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait textarea.click();\nawait textarea.type(MESSAGE);\n```\n\n### Puppeteer Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` (Lines 272-274)\n```javascript\nawait page.waitForSelector('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', { visible: true });\nawait page.click('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait page.type('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', MESSAGE);\n```\n\n**Key Details:**\n- Targets the textarea with `data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"`\n- The MESSAGE variable is defined at lines 93-100 in both files\n- Both versions verify the typed message matches before submission\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Job Application Handling**\n\nThe job application logic is in both main files and follows this flow:\n\n### Main Application Loop:\n**Both Files** (lines 199-298)\n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. **Finds \"Откликнуться\" buttons** - Russian text meaning \"Respond\" or \"Apply\"\n   - Playwright: `page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Откликнуться' })`\n   - Puppeteer: Searches through all links for exact text match\n\n2. **Handles Navigation/Modal:** Uses `Promise.race()` to handle both redirect and modal popup scenarios\n\n3. **Adds Cover Letter:** Clicks \"Добавить сопроводительное\" (Add Cover Letter)\n\n4. **Fills Form:** Clicks textarea and types the message\n\n5. **Submits:** Clicks the submit button `[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-submit-popup\"]`\n\n6. **Waits Between Applications:** Respects the `--job-application-interval` flag (default 20 seconds)\n\n7. **Handles Redirects:** If a separate form page appears, waits for user to complete it manually and return\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Main Entry Points and Application Structure**\n\n### **Two Entry Points:**\n\n1. **Playwright Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Playwright browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run playwright`\n\n2. **Puppeteer Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Puppeteer browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run puppeteer`\n\n3. **In-Browser DevTools Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js`\n   - Lightweight version to paste into browser console\n   - Demonstrates the core clicking logic\n\n### **Application Structure:**\n\n```\nMain Flow:\n1. Parse CLI arguments (yargs)\n   - --url: Target URL (job search page)\n   - --manual-login: Enable manual login\n   - --job-application-interval: Seconds between applications\n   - --user-data-dir: Persistent session storage\n\n2. Setup Browser\n   - Launch with persistent user data directory\n   - Disable translation, infobars, crash restore popups\n   - Load cookies/session from previous runs\n\n3. Handle Login\n   - If --manual-login: Show login page and wait for redirect\n   - Otherwise: Navigate directly to URL\n\n4. Main Automation Loop\n   ├─ Find all \"Откликнуться\" buttons\n   ├─ Click first button\n   ├─ Wait for modal form\n   ├─ Click \"Добавить сопроводительное\"\n   ├─ Type message in textarea\n   ├─ Click submit button\n   ├─ Wait for interval\n   └─ Repeat until no more buttons\n\n5. Graceful Shutdown\n   - Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM\n   - Detect user closing browser tab\n   - Close browser safely\n```\n\n### **Key Configuration:**\n- **Default Message** (lines 93-100): Customizable via `MESSAGE` env variable or hardcoded default (Russian text asking about remote work arrangements and GitHub links)\n- **Default URL:** `https://hh.ru/search/vacancy?from=resumelist`\n- **Default Interval:** 20 seconds between applications\n- **Session Storage:** `~/.hh-automation/playwright-data` or `~/.hh-automation/puppeteer-data`\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Important Files Summary**\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Playwright |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Puppeteer |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js` | Browser console script for manual testing |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/eslint.config.js` | Linting configuration |"

Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Textarea Message Typing**\n\nThe code that types messages into the textarea is located in **TWO places** (one for each browser automation library):\n\n### Playwright Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` (Lines 269-271)\n```javascript\nconst textarea = page.locator('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait textarea.click();\nawait textarea.type(MESSAGE);\n```\n\n### Puppeteer Version:\n**File:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` (Lines 272-274)\n```javascript\nawait page.waitForSelector('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', { visible: true });\nawait page.click('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]');\nawait page.type('textarea[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"]', MESSAGE);\n```\n\n**Key Details:**\n- Targets the textarea with `data-qa=\"vacancy-response-popup-form-letter-input\"`\n- The MESSAGE variable is defined at lines 93-100 in both files\n- Both versions verify the typed message matches before submission\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Job Application Handling**\n\nThe job application logic is in both main files and follows this flow:\n\n### Main Application Loop:\n**Both Files** (lines 199-298)\n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. **Finds \"Откликнуться\" buttons** - Russian text meaning \"Respond\" or \"Apply\"\n   - Playwright: `page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Откликнуться' })`\n   - Puppeteer: Searches through all links for exact text match\n\n2. **Handles Navigation/Modal:** Uses `Promise.race()` to handle both redirect and modal popup scenarios\n\n3. **Adds Cover Letter:** Clicks \"Добавить сопроводительное\" (Add Cover Letter)\n\n4. **Fills Form:** Clicks textarea and types the message\n\n5. **Submits:** Clicks the submit button `[data-qa=\"vacancy-response-submit-popup\"]`\n\n6. **Waits Between Applications:** Respects the `--job-application-interval` flag (default 20 seconds)\n\n7. **Handles Redirects:** If a separate form page appears, waits for user to complete it manually and return\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Main Entry Points and Application Structure**\n\n### **Two Entry Points:**\n\n1. **Playwright Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Playwright browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run playwright`\n\n2. **Puppeteer Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js`\n   - Uses Puppeteer browser automation library\n   - Run with: `npm run puppeteer`\n\n3. **In-Browser DevTools Version:** `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js`\n   - Lightweight version to paste into browser console\n   - Demonstrates the core clicking logic\n\n### **Application Structure:**\n\n```\nMain Flow:\n1. Parse CLI arguments (yargs)\n   - --url: Target URL (job search page)\n   - --manual-login: Enable manual login\n   - --job-application-interval: Seconds between applications\n   - --user-data-dir: Persistent session storage\n\n2. Setup Browser\n   - Launch with persistent user data directory\n   - Disable translation, infobars, crash restore popups\n   - Load cookies/session from previous runs\n\n3. Handle Login\n   - If --manual-login: Show login page and wait for redirect\n   - Otherwise: Navigate directly to URL\n\n4. Main Automation Loop\n   ├─ Find all \"Откликнуться\" buttons\n   ├─ Click first button\n   ├─ Wait for modal form\n   ├─ Click \"Добавить сопроводительное\"\n   ├─ Type message in textarea\n   ├─ Click submit button\n   ├─ Wait for interval\n   └─ Repeat until no more buttons\n\n5. Graceful Shutdown\n   - Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM\n   - Detect user closing browser tab\n   - Close browser safely\n```\n\n### **Key Configuration:**\n- **Default Message** (lines 93-100): Customizable via `MESSAGE` env variable or hardcoded default (Russian text asking about remote work arrangements and GitHub links)\n- **Default URL:** `https://hh.ru/search/vacancy?from=resumelist`\n- **Default Interval:** 20 seconds between applications\n- **Session Storage:** `~/.hh-automation/playwright-data` or `~/.hh-automation/puppeteer-data`\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Important Files Summary**\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/playwright-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Playwright |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/puppeteer-click-and-type.js` | Main automation using Puppeteer |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/inbrowser-clicks.js` | Browser console script for manual testing |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |\n| `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1762231652133/eslint.config.js` | Linting configuration |"

Have clear, version-specific titles (e.g., \"chore: version packages (v0.3.0)\")\n2. Automatically include synchronized package-lock.json updates\n3.

When no plain `Request` or `WebSocket` parameter was found, the code would add a synthetic `___dishka_request` parameter of type `Request`\n2. This synthetic parameter was used to access the dishka container via `.state.dishka_container`\n3. However, WebSocket handlers receive `WebSocket` objects from FastAPI, not `Request` objects\n4. When the injected function tried to access `kwargs[\"___dishka_request\"].state.dishka_container`, it failed with a KeyError because FastAPI never provided a `___dishka_request` parameter to WebSocket handlers\n\nThe original attempt to fix this by modifying `_find_request_param()` was treating the symptom rather than the root cause, as pointed out in the code review feedback.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe fix detects whether the function is a WebSocket handler by checking if it has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies:\n\n1. Added a new `_needs_websocket_param()` function that checks if any `FromDishka` dependencies are of type `WebSocket`\n2. Created a new `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` synthetic parameter (in addition to the existing `DISHKA_REQUEST_PARAM`)\n3. Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to choose the appropriate synthetic parameter:\n   - If the function has `FromDishka[WebSocket]` dependencies, add `___dishka_websocket: WebSocket`\n   - Otherwise, add `___dishka_request: Request`\n4. Both Request and WebSocket objects have `.state.dishka_container`, so the container access works correctly\n\n## Changes\n\n- **src/dishka/integrations/fastapi.py**: \n  - Added `DISHKA_WEBSOCKET_PARAM` constant\n  - Added `_needs_websocket_param()` helper function\n  - Modified `_wrap_fastapi_injection()` to detect WebSocket handlers and add the appropriate parameter\n  - Added imports for `get_args` and `get_origin` from typing\n- **tests/integrations/fastapi/test_fastapi_websockets.py**: Added regression test `test_fromdishka_websocket_only()`\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded a new test case that reproduces the original issue:\n\n```python\nasync def get_with_fromdishka_websocket_only(\n    ws: FromDishka[WebSocket],\n    mock: FromDishka[Mock],\n) -\u003e None:\n    await ws.accept()\n    await ws.receive()\n    mock(\"ok\")\n    await ws.send_text(\"passed\")\n```\n\nThis test verifies that handlers can use `FromDishka[WebSocket]` without requiring a plain `WebSocket` parameter.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:48:03Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/reagento/dishka/issues/575","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #575","oid":"5ec21e248a109ba320b7e7c6ac812a1d70b8990d"},{"authoredDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-09T07:52:18Z","messageBody":"… parameter\n\nThe issue occurred when _find_request_param() found parameters marked with\nFromDishka (e.g., FromDishka[WebSocket]) and tried to use them to access\nthe container.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Updating PR Title with Changesets Action\n\nThe pull request title can be customized using the `title` parameter in the changesets action configuration. The default title is \"Version Packages\".\n\nHere's how to configure it in your GitHub workflow:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Create Release Pull Request\n  uses: changesets/action@v1\n  with:\n    title: \"chore: update versions\"  # Custom PR title\n    commit: \"chore: update versions\"  # Custom commit message\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThe pnpm documentation shows an example using `title: \"chore: update versions\"` as a configuration option.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe automatically created PR will contain all changes from the contributor plus a new commit that bumps the version and updates CHANGELOG.md. While the default title is generic, you can customize it to include specific text, though the version number itself is typically shown in the PR body and changelog rather than the title.\n\nIf you want to dynamically include the actual version number in the PR title, you would need to create a custom script or use additional GitHub Actions steps to extract the version from `package.json` and update the PR title programmatically using the GitHub API."

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n## Changesets and package-lock.json Updates\n\nWhen using npm, running `changeset version` does not update the version in the lock file. This is a known issue documented in the Changesets GitHub repository.\n\n### The Solution\n\nRunning `npm install` ensures that the version is updated in the package-lock.json file after running `changeset version`. This does not appear to have any ill effect and may be purely cosmetic.\n\n### Similar Issue with pnpm\n\nThis same problem exists with pnpm as well. When using pnpm with changesets in a monorepo, after merging the \"Update Versions\" PR from the changesets action, CI breaks on the \"Install\" step since changesets has updated the versions in linked packages but has not updated the pnpm-lock.yaml.\n\n### How npm Handles package-lock.json Updates\n\npackage-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.\n\n### Best Practice\n\nAfter running `changeset version` to bump your package versions, you should run `npm install` to ensure the package-lock.json file is updated to reflect the new versions."
